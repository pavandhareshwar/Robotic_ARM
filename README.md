# Robotic_ARM
Repository for MCIoT project
Objective: To design an IoT based system that monitors an environment and controls a two degrees of freedom robot to pick and place in the same environment via Bluetooth.

Motivation: There are several situations when an activity must be done in a room by humans but a human cannot enter the place because of its environment. Such environments can be popularly found in laboratories handling hazardous materials. Even after taking many precautions, because of unforeseen human errors, people get into trouble. Having a cheap and workable solution for this problem could save many lives. In such a place, we can place a robot that can imitate a human body and hence isolate the two. This project demonstrates a miniscule version of the system explained above.
